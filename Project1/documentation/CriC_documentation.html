            <h2>2. User types</h2>
            <div>
                &emsp; The application admits multiple types of users, each of them being provided with various functionalities.
                <h3>2.1. Regular user</h3>
                <div>
                    <h4>2.1.1. Unuthenticated user/Guest</h4>
                    <p>
                        &emsp; This kind of user has minimal access to the application. He can either register in order to become an authenticated user, 
                        or just use the functionalities provided for him: view the lists of shelters, alerts and missing persons.
                        They will also receive an notification when there is a new alert added.
                    </p>
                    <h4>2.1.2. Authenticated user</h4>
                    <p>
                        &emsp;This kind of user has already created an account and has logged in. In addition to the functionalities of a guest, 
                        this user can also request adding or removing a missing person in the database. If the request to add a missing 
                        person succeeds, the user will receive a notification when the person is found. The removal of a missing person
                        means that the person has been found. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h3>2.2. Organization</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp;This is the most powerful kind of user in this application. They belong to profile organisations or authorities.
                    They can use any of the functionalities mentioned before. They are also responsable of adding or removing shelters,
                    missing persons or alerts and checking if the request to do so is justified.
